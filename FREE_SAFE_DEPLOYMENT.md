## Recommendation: Railway 🚂

**Why Railway is best for your needs:**

1. ✅ **Safest free option that stays running**
   - Modern security practices
   - Reliable infrastructure
   - Good track record

2. ✅ **Free to run exactly as is**
   - $5/month credit is usually enough for small apps
   - Stays running (no sleep)
   - No functionality limitations

3. ✅ **Best user experience**
   - Always accessible
   - Fast response times
   - No wake-up delays

4. ✅ **Easy setup**

## Cost Breakdown

### Railway:
- **Free:** $5/month credit
- **Your app usage:** Likely $0-3/month (small app)
- **Cost to you:** $0/month ✅
- **If you exceed:** Pay-as-you-go (unlikely for your use case)

### Heroku:
- **Free:** Hobby dyno
- **Cost:** $0/month ✅
- **But:** App sleeps (not "exactly as is")

### Render:
- **Free:** Free tier

## Safety Comparison

| Platform | Safety Rating | Established | Security | Reliability |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Heroku** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 2007 (17 years) | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Railway** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 2020 (4 years) | Very Good | Very Good |
| **Render** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 2019 (5 years) | Very Good | Very Good |

**All three are safe**, but Heroku has the longest track record.

**However:** Railway is modern, well-maintained, and has excellent security practices. It's safe enough for production use.
